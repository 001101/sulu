### SnippetBundle 

Not specifying a snippetType in the snippets content type will allow a choice
from ALL snippet types instead of only the default snippet type. Therefore you
must explicitly declare the snippet type in a parameter or accept the new
behavior of showing all snippet types. 

See the
[documentation](https://github.com/sulu-cmf/docs/blob/master/developer-documentation/300-webspaces/snippets.md)
for more details.
