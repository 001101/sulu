# Upgrade

## dev-develop
* Remove `/cmf/<webspace>/temp` from repository
  * run `app/console doctrine:phpcr:node:remove /cmf/<webspace>/temp` foreach webspace

## 0.12.0
* Permissions have to be correct now, because they are applied
  * otherwise add a permission value of 120 for `sulu.security.roles`,
    `sulu.security.groups` and `sulu.security.users` to one user to change
    the settings in the UI
  * also check for the correct value in the `locale`-column of the `se_user_roles`-table
    * value has to be a json-string (e.g. `["en", "de"]`)
* Snippet content type defaults to all snippet types available instead of the
  default one
  * Explicitly define a snippet type in the parameters if this is not desired
