# Upgrade

## dev-develop

### Websocket Component

Websocket start command changed to `app/console sulu:websocket:run`. If you use xdebug on your server please start
websockets with `app/console sulu:websocket:run -e prod`.

Default behavior is that websocket turned of for preview, if you want to use it turn it on in the
`app/config/admin/config.yml` under:

```yml
 sulu_content:
     preview:
         mode: auto       # possibilities [auto, on_request, off]
         websocket: false # use websockets for preview, if true it tries to connect to websocket server,
                          # if that fails it uses ajax as a fallback
         delay: 300       # used for the delayed send of changes, lesser delay are more request but less latency
```

### HTTP Cache

The HTTP cache integration has been refactored. The following configuration
must be **removed**:

````yaml
sulu_core:
    # ...
    http_cache:
        type: symfonyHttpCache
````

The Symfony HTTP cache is enabled by default now, so there is no need to do
anything else. See the [HTTP cache
documentation](http://sulu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/bundles/http_cache.html)
for more information.

### Renamed RequestAnalyzerInterface methods

The text "Current" has been removed from all of the request analyzer methods.
If you used the request analyzer service then you will probably need to update
your code, see: https://github.com/sulu-cmf/sulu/pull/749/files#diff-23
